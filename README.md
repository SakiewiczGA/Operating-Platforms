# Operating-Platforms
The software design document was created for a fictional company named The Gaming Room.  The Gaming Room has a game currently on Android but wanted to expand their game to various operating platforms.  The game required login/password requirements, team and game names could not be replicated while being used.  The design document helped manage coding solutions and planning.  The summary of Linux is more complex, that is what I would revisit.  The user's needs were initially used to finish the UML diagram, which helped finishing the code successfully to meet certain requirements for the game functionality.  Dropwizard is something I will need to revisit when creating another RestFul app as well as implementing security.
